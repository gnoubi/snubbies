\section{Ecological bases}

This model has been inspired by earlier works carried out by \href{https://gdri-ehede.univ-fcomte.fr}{GDRI EHEDE} researchers \citep{Li2015,Clauzel2015,Li2017}.

In brief, after \citet{Li2015}, the black-and-white snub-nosed monkey \textit{Rhinopithecus bieti} is endemic to Yunnan and Tibet, China, and categorized as "endangered" in the IUCN Red List. Surveys have shown that the monkeys live in 15 isolated groups, 12 of them in Yunnan, in a narrow range of the Three Parallel Rivers region, one of the most ecologically important areas of China, the rugged terrain of which makes it difficult to carry out surveys. The species is threatened by habitat alteration, poaching and economic activities such as farming and collection of timber. The areas between populations are damaged by logging, grazing, mining, agriculture and firewood collection. Because of this habitat fragmentation the monkeys may incur a high energy cost if they travel long distances between habitat patches. Fragmentation may subsequently prevent genetic exchange between populations, making the species more vulnerable to extinction. Where required, reserve managers need to establish habitat corridors to facilitate exchange between populations, identifying priority areas for restoration to increase landscape connectivity.

"Snubbies" is a nickname given to the species.

\section{Geography and data}

 Tab.~\ref{tab:habitats} describes the 5 habitat types defined by \citet{Li2017} and fig.~\ref{fig:studyarea} shows the study area and the location of the monkey groups with their ID number.
 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item The shapefile \texttt{source2P} corresponds to this map, and the predefined style file \texttt{source2P.qml} can be used in QGIS for a better display. The attribute \texttt{DN} gives the habitat types of Tab.~\ref{tab:habitats}.
 \item The shapefile \texttt{source2P\_envconv} is the concave polygon of \texttt{source2P}
 \item The shapefile \texttt{groups} gives the geographical limit of each monkey group. The group ID number, the name of the area and a population size estimate are given as attributes.
 \end{itemize}

\section{Model purpose}
Here we want to build a multi-agent model to simulate and explore the effect of habitat and life-history trait 
parameters (real values known or unknown) on snubby dispersion.

\section{Model parameters}

\subsection{Input parameters}
\begin{description}
	\item[step] 1 hour (the iteration time resolution)
	\item[maximum speed] the maximum speed (km/day) that can sustain a snubby in a favourable habitat
	\item[maximum survival]  [0,1] the maximum survival in a favourable habitat. The end user give it per year ($s_y$), but this should be converted to the scale of the step (here hour), using the following formula: $s_h=e^{\frac{\ln{s_y}}{365\times24}}$
	\item[disperser proportion] the proportion of snubbies who evade their group and wander outside. The end user give it per year  ($p_y$), but this should be converted to the scale of the step (hour): $p_h=e^{\frac{\ln{p_y}}{365\times24}}$
	\item[habitat viscosity] [0,1] the resistance of a given habitat.  Multiplies the maximum speed to give the speed really sustained in this habitat.
	\item[habitat security] [0,1] the security of a given habitat.  Multiplies the maximum survival to give the actual survival in this habitat.
	\item[long perception distance] [default: 6 km] the radius within which a wandering snubby choose a long distance target.
	\item[short perception distance] [default: long perception distance/3] the radius within which a wandering snubby chose a stepping stone habitat (short distance target) to the long distance target.
	\item[angle] [default: 45\degree] the half-angle on each side of the bearing direction to the long distance target within which a wandering snubby chose a short distance target.
	\item[minimum habitat quality for a long distance target, MHQLD] [default: 4] the minimum habitat quality to be chosen as a long distance target.
	\item[minimum habitat quality for a short distance target, MHQSD]  [default: 2] the minimum habitat quality to be chosen as a short distance target.
	
.
\end{description}

\subsection{During simulation}

\begin{itemize}
	\item When one snubby dies, one snubby is created in its aboriginal group.
	\item A wandering snubby chooses a long distance target randomly in habitats whose quality is equal or above \texttt{MHQLD} within the \texttt{long perception distance} radius. Then it chooses a short distance target (stepping stone) randomly in habitats whose quality is equal or above \texttt{MHQSD}  within the \texttt{short perception distance} radius and within a sector defined by the \texttt{angle} on each side of the bearing direction to the long distance target. Then, it moves to the short distance target crossing habitats of various quality (speed and survival are applied according to \texttt{habitat viscosit}y and \texttt{habitat security}) (see fig.~\ref{fig:movementrules}). When it reaches the long distance target, it chooses another long distance target. The process is repeated iteratively until it dies or reaches another group on the way and integrate that group.
\end{itemize}
